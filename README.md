## Personal Note
Git commit history is not available for this project because it was developed on a low-end system.
Running Git or Git Extensions in VS Code significantly slowed down the editor, often causing it to hang.
As a result, version control was managed manually outside of VS Code for this project.


## ðŸš€ Run Locally

Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tousher101/Snake-Game.git

#Then, simply open index.html in your browser
